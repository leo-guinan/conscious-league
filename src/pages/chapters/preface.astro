      <p>
        It started with a single article.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        A short report on Harvard's grade inflation landed in my inbox one morning.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Within an hour, that single data point unfolded into a network of ideas: three essays,
        two Renaissance-style images, a manifesto on competition, and a new architecture for academia.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        One input. Infinite output.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        That acceleration wasn't a trick of software; it was a demonstration of <strong>conscious speed</strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        When awareness aligns across layers — emotional, intellectual, ethical — the mind becomes
        a compression engine.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        It converts information into coherence at light speed.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        That is the moment a player "awakens": when you realize that attention, not effort, is
        the real energy source of creation.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We built this book to describe that awakening, to map what happens when intelligence stops
        chasing productivity and starts compounding awareness.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We call this new domain the <strong>Conscious League</strong> — a civilization-wide sport
        where the goal is not domination but integration, not victory but visibility.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In this League, your score is measured by how much time you return to the field, not how
        much you consume.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Every essay, theorem, and diagram in the following chapters is an artifact of that same
        experiment: a proof that consciousness can out-produce capital and out-design complexity.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If the industrial age rewarded those who extracted resources, the conscious age will reward
        those who liberate time.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Welcome to the game.
