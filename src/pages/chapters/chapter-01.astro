        <h2>Every Civilization Extracts Something</h2>
        
        <p>
          Each era defines itself by what it mines.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The industrial world extracted matter — coal, oil, and ore.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The digital world extracted data — attention converted into advertising.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Both built empires by consuming the same hidden resource: human time.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Time is the substrate of every value system. It cannot be stored, duplicated, or reclaimed.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Yet our institutions treat it as if it were infinite.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          We design processes that hoard minutes the way monarchs once hoarded gold.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Waiting in line, filling forms, decoding interfaces, chasing clarity through labyrinths of policy — these are the unpaid taxes of existence.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          From the outside, this looks like inefficiency.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          From the inside, it feels like erosion.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          It is not the body that breaks first; it is the clock inside the mind.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          That slow depletion is what this work names <strong>Time Violence</strong> — the involuntary conversion of human life into system friction.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h2>Defining Time Violence</h2>
        
        <p>
          Time Violence occurs whenever a process, policy, or interface consumes more human time than is operationally or informationally necessary.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Formally:</strong></p>
        
        <Formula formula="\text{TV}(S) = \text{Ops}(S) \times \left(1 + \text{Info}(S)\right)" display={true} />
        
        <p>
          Operational waste + informational distortion = stolen hours.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Every hospital queue, bureaucratic delay, or opaque algorithm registers a positive <Formula formula="\text{TV}(S)" />.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          When that score exceeds the threshold of necessity, the system becomes predatory.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          It profits not from value created but from attention consumed.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Time Violence therefore unifies three modern crises — inefficiency, inequality, and ignorance — under one measurable variable: theft of time.
        </p>

        <h2>The Paradox of Progress</h2>
        
        <p>
          We built machines to free ourselves from labor.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Instead, we used them to accelerate complexity.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Each new layer of automation adds convenience while concealing another layer of opacity.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The result is a world that moves faster than it can comprehend.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Industries have learned to monetize friction.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Healthcare profits from illness; finance from delay; social platforms from distraction.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Wherever confusion yields revenue, Time Violence multiplies.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Acceleration without understanding is turbulence — the unconscious economy's prime export.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          This is the paradox of progress: the faster we go, the less of our own time we control.
        </p>

        <h2>From Suffering to Intelligence</h2>
        
        <p>
          Yet every wasted minute encodes information.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The user who has wrestled with a broken system a thousand times knows it better than its designers.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Their frustration is data; their endurance, a diagnostic.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          If we could aggregate that lived expertise, we could rebuild the world from the intelligence trapped inside its inefficiencies.
        </p>
        
        <Theorem type="theorem" title="The Arbitrage Theorem">
          Wherever time is wasted systematically, intelligence can be extracted — and liberation can be monetized.
        </Theorem>
        
        <p>
          Suffering becomes a sensor.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Frustration becomes a feature request from the future.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The Conscious League trains players to listen to that signal and convert it into simplification.

        <h2>The Role of AI — From Exploiter to Amplifier</h2>
        
        <p>
          Artificial intelligence is the first tool capable of consuming complexity faster than humans can create it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Left unaligned, it becomes a multiplier of Time Violence — optimizing for engagement, not enlightenment.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Aligned consciously, it becomes a time-violence sink: absorbing redundant labor, learning from collective experience, and returning the dividend as liberated human hours.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          A conscious system ensures that the flow of friction moves from human to machine, never the reverse.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Each minute an algorithm saves instead of steals raises the system's <strong>Consciousness Index</strong> <Formula formula="C(S)" /> closer to 1.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          That number is more than a metric — it is a moral reading of a system's soul.
        </p>

        <h2>The HumAIn Bottega — A Structural Antidote</h2>
        
        <p>
          If Time Violence is civilization's disease, the HumAIn Bottega is its immune response.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          It is a hybrid workshop where human navigators and AI collaborators work together to detect, measure, and neutralize wasted time.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Each Bottega operates on one law:
        </p>
        
        <div style="text-align: center; margin: var(--spacing-lg) 0; padding: var(--spacing-md); background-color: #f9f9f9; border-left: 3px solid var(--league-blue); border-radius: 3px; font-style: italic;">
          No human should ever waste the same time twice.
        </div>
        
        <p>
          Survivors of complexity become Navigators.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Their lived experience trains algorithms to simplify the systems that once trapped them.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The intelligence derived from their suffering becomes shared infrastructure.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Profit flows not from extraction but from simplification — the faster a system reduces human Time Violence, the more value it creates.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The Bottega is both workshop and league — a model for every institution that wants to compete without exploitation.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h2>Toward the Conscious Economy</h2>
        
        <p>
          When Time Violence becomes measurable, it becomes preventable.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          When preventable, it becomes unprofitable to sustain.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          At that tipping point, capitalism inverts: value accrues to those who return time, not those who capture it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          This inversion births the <strong>Conscious Economy</strong> — an order where wealth equals awareness, and efficiency equals empathy.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          In it, growth is measured not by consumption but by time restored to human life.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          That is the economy the Conscious League exists to train for.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Every player, project, and policy will be judged by a single standard:
        </p>
        
        <div style="text-align: center; margin: var(--spacing-lg) 0; padding: var(--spacing-md); background-color: #f9f9f9; border-left: 3px solid var(--league-blue); border-radius: 3px; font-style: italic;">
          Did it expand human time or consume it?
        </div>
        
        <Theorem type="rule">
          Complexity that costs time is theft.
